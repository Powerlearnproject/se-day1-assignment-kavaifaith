#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
  - Supports business and economic growth - enables the creation of software applications and systems which enhance productivity, automate tasks, and improve customer experiences
  - Improves scalability and maintainability in that well-engineered software can be easily updated, scaled, and modified to accommodate new features, business growth, and changing user needs.
  - Enhances security in that software engineering practices which include risk assessment, encryption, and secure coding techniques protect systems from cyber threats.
    

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The NATO Conference
- The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s)
- The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - design software architecture and user interface
Implementation - writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the system meets quality standards and check for bugs.
Deployment - release the software to the users
Maintenance - provide ongoing support.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall- sequential approach with distinct phases. Each phase is completed before moving on
        - Can be used in Large-Scale Infrastructure or Government Projects
        - Projects with fixed requirements and budgets
  
  Agile - it is an iterative and flexible development process. It has repeated iterations
    - can be used in web-based or cloud applications
    - software startups and product development e.g mobile app development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Endineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs -   it has built-in debuggers help identify and fix errors quickly.
     -   IDEs provide project management tools, making large projects easier to navigate.
     -   Offers features like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and code suggestions, speeding up coding.
examples; visual studio code , eclipse
VCS  -   Maintains a history of changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
     -   Developers can review each other’s work through pull requests and code reviews.
     -    Enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
     

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. The tech industry evolves rapidly, requiring software engineers to constantly update their knowledge of new programming languages, frameworks, and tools. this can be overcomed by engaging in continuous learning through online courses
2.  Identifying and fixing software bugs can be time-consuming, especially in large codebases - use debugging toolss , Write unit tests and integration tests to catch bugs early.
3.  Software engineers often face high-pressure deadlines, leading to stress and burnout - Use Agile methodologies to break projects into manageable tasks , Communicate realistic timelines with managers and stakeholders.
4.  Clients or stakeholders often change project requirements mid-development, leading to scope creep - Use Agile development to accommodate changes incrementally

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing - Testing individual components or modules of software.
System testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing -  Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

 Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. 
 Well-structured prompts reduce misinterpretation and lead to more precise responses.
 A refined prompt saves time by reducing the need for multiple follow-up prompts to refine the answer.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - tell me about cybersecurity
improved version - What are the three main principles of cybersecurity, and why are they important
        More specific – Focuses on three key principles.
        Clear purpose – Asks for both explanation and importance.
         Concise – Easy to understand while guiding the AI toward a useful answer.
